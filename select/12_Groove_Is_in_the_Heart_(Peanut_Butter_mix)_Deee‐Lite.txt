Groove Is In The Heart
You're going to dance
You're going to dance
You're going to dance
And have some fun

Dig

The chills that you spill up my back
Keep me filled with satisfaction when we're done
Satisfaction of what's to come

I couldn't ask for another
No, I couldn't ask for another

Another try

Your groove, I do deeply dig
No walls, only the bridge, my supperdish
My succotash wish

Singing, baby
I couldn't ask for another
No, I couldn't ask for another

Groove is in the heart, Groove is in the heart
Groove is in the heart, Groove is in the heart

Watch out!

The depth of hula groove
Move us to the nth hoop
We're going thru to, Horten hears a who

I couldn't ask for another
No, I couldn't ask for another

DJ Soul was on a roll
I been told he can't be sold
Not vicious or malicious
Just de-lovely and delicious

I couldn't ask for another
No, I couldn't ask for another

Groove is in the heart...
