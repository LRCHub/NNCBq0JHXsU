I was inside
Goin' outside
I was feeling fine
In the 9-to-5

Just getting by
Just the right time
It was the butter
Of '69

[Chorus]
It makes me down, down, down
Makes me down

I was inside
Goin' outside
I was feeling fine
In the 9-to-5

I'll shine
Out of mind
It was the butter
Of '69

[Chorus]

Butter of '69
Butter of '69
Butter of '69
Butter of '69
Butter of '69

[Chorus]

Butter of '69
Butter of '69
Butter of '69
Butter of '69
