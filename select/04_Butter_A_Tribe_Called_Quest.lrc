[00:10.35] 1988 Senior Year at Garvey High
[00:25.85] 
[00:12.80] Where all the guys were corny but the girls were mad fly
[00:15.36] Lounging with the Tipster, cooling with Sha
[00:17.80] Scoping out the honeys—they know who they are
[00:20.29] I was the b-ball playing, fly rhyme saying
[00:23.16] Fly girl getting but never was I sweating
[00:25.58] Cause when it came to honeys I would go on a stroll
[00:27.97] Until I met my match—her name was Flo
[00:31.02] Yeah, I messed around with the one called Flo
[00:33.52] All the troopers 'round the way used to call her a ho
[00:36.27] But deep down in my heart I knew that Flo was good to go
[00:38.96] Cause I thought it was me like Bell Biv Devoe
[00:41.34] But little did I know that she was playing with my mind
[00:44.06] The only thing I learned is good girls are hard to find
[00:46.61] I feel like Heavy D I need somebody for me
[00:49.16] Not someone whose mind is blank
[00:50.38] And trying to juice me for my banks
[00:51.96] Swinging with my main man Lucky behind my back
[00:54.45] What type of crap is that—yo, how's about a smack?
[00:56.93] Word life, I can't front, thought I was all that
[00:59.64] But now it seems, I've met my match
[01:02.10] I was a stone cold lover, you couldn't tell me jack
[01:04.78] Settling down with one girl, wasn't trying to hear that
[01:07.25] I had Tonya, Tamika, Sharon, Karen, Tina, Stacy, Julie, Tracy
[01:12.49] Used to love 'em, leave 'em, skeeze 'em, tease 'em
[01:15.34] Find 'em, lose 'em - also abuse 'em
[01:17.78] My whole attitude was new day, next hon
[01:20.72] And believe it or not, they all got done
[01:22.96] Well here comes Flo, with the crazy whip appeal
[01:25.55] And I'm all true man, like Alexander O'Neal
[01:28.36] Is this really love, then again how would I know
[01:30.82] After all this time trying to be a Super Ho
[01:33.65] She finally played me, but yo I'd find another
[01:35.73] Cause I got the crazy game and yo, I'm smooth like butter
[02:04.23] 
[01:38.72] It's like Butter, it's like butter baby
[01:58.22] 
[01:41.04] It's like Butter, it's like butter baby
[02:00.54] 
[01:43.60] It's like Butter, it's like butter baby
[02:03.10] 
[01:46.10] It's like Butter, it's like butter baby
[02:05.60] 
[01:48.91] It's like Butter, it's like butter baby
[02:08.41] 
[01:51.42] It's like Butter, like the butter baby
[01:54.03] Not no Parkay, not no margarine,
[01:56.39] Strickly butter baby, strictly butter baby
[02:17.39] 
[01:59.28] I remember when girls were goodie two shoes but now they turned to freaks
[02:01.87] All of a sudden ("We love you Phife")
[02:03.55] Ease off ho, my name's Malik
[02:04.40] Phife this, Phife that, where you going, where you at
[02:07.03] These girls don't know me from jack, yet I feel like the Mack
[02:09.84] You didn't want me then, so yo hon, don't want me now
[02:12.26] Here, Here - take the towel, wipe off your brow
[02:14.99] And take the contact out your eye, you're far from looking fly
[02:17.78] You get an E for effort, and T for nice try
[02:20.30] Now tell me what's the reason, for dying your hair
[02:22.89] Slum village gold still dangling in your ear
[02:25.56] You barely have a neck but still sporting a rope
[02:28.15] Four-finger ring just so Phife can scope
[02:30.59] You looked in the mirror, didn't know what to do
[02:33.09] Yesterday your eyes were brown but today they are blue
[02:36.23] Your whole appearance is a lie and it could never be true
[02:38.60] And if you really liked yourself then you would try and be you
[02:40.86] If your hair and eyes were real, I wouldn't have dissed ya
[02:43.59] But since it was bought, I had to dismiss ya
[02:46.57] But if you can't achieve it, then why not try and weave it
[02:48.79] If you can't extend it then you might as well suspend it
[02:51.84] If you can't braid it, best thing to do is fade it
[02:54.20] I asked who did your hair and you tell me Diane made it
[02:56.91] If you were you and just you, talk to you, maybe
[02:59.49] But I can't stand, no bionic lady
[03:01.91] Trying hard to look fly, but yo, you're looking dumber
[03:04.62] If I wanted someone like you I would've swung with Jaime Sommers
[03:07.20] You wanna be treated right, see Father MC
[03:09.73] Or check Ralph Tresvant, for sensitivity
[03:12.55] Cause I am not the one, I got more game than Parker Brothers
[03:14.80] Phife Dog is on the mic and I'm smooth like butter
